  <h1>The Very First Charity Giveaway - 22 Kids, 5 Dinners </h1>
  <div class="meta">2025-08-08</div>
  </section>


<!Blog>  
  <p>I came to the Philippines to start a charity, and in December 2024 I ran my very first giveaway. We handed out toys to 22 kids and provided a dinner to 5 families.</p>
</section>

This wouldn’t have happened without my friend who scouted the families and managed the giveaway in person. To show my gratitude to her for doing something I wasn't able to do myself, I bought her family a washing machine.</p>
</section>

I also made a conscious choice to stay hidden and let my friend be the complete face of this giveaway. Being one of the few foreigners in town makes me easy to spot, and I didn’t want people to start expecting handouts whenever they saw me.</p>
</section>

The total cost for this first giveaway was approximately ₱10,000. I want to say thanks to my dad, as he helped fund this giveaway.</p>

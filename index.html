    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <section class="card-inner">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’ve wanted to be like Santa Claus ever since I was little. Now I'm making that dream real by helping communities and individuals. When I have free time or am unable to fund my own projects, I spend it volunteering to support others with theirs.</p>
      <p><u>This is not an official charity and I do not collect any donations.</u></p>
    </section>

    <!-- COMMUNITY PROJECTS -->
    <section class="card-inner">
      <h2>Community Projects</h2>
      <p>I’ve taken a shift in my approach to helping others. In the past, I’ve given away Christmas presents and hosted meal giveaways, but now I focus on providing resources that offer long-term benefits for the people who receive them. At the moment, my efforts are centered on school-related needs, but I’m always open to addressing other community challenges and individual problems.</p>

    <!-- VOLUNTEERING -->
    <section class="card-inner">
      <h2>Volunteering</h2>
      <p>I’m always looking for individuals who can lend a hand, as my own resources are limited. My goal is to build a team of volunteers who can not only help me with my projects but also assist others with theirs. I’ll never share your information. If I think you're a good match for one of my projects or someone else's, I’ll contact you directly.</p>
